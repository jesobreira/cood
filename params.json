{"name":"Cood","tagline":"Restaurant-based esolang","body":"## The Cood Programming Language\r\n\r\nCood (code and food) is an interpreted stack-based esolang (esoteric programming language) I made based on the phrases you usually will say in a restaurant.\r\n\r\nAs it's simple, anyone can create an interpreter/compiler for it. I've made three interpreters: AutoIt, PHP and Javascript (running on this page, below).\r\n\r\nMore details about it [on my blog](http://jefrey.ml/cood).\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n* [32 bits interpreter here](https://mega.co.nz/#!84klRAAb!YP54zKS3XZ9CmSvI6U6zoZ1d5c1YOHUqVXK6VPTTzss)\r\n* [64 bits interpreter here](https://mega.co.nz/#!JssTybwB!7SeVADIAcFbGCye4Vdyh6BXgburgqy_4Qw_gPPI-paM)\r\n* [32 bits bamcompiled (a little heavy cause it includes php.exe, but faster, maybe 'cause of Memcache)](https://mega.co.nz/#!94EH0CTQ!T9UI7YQNVmsSr8a2IuhC9TxdmEZim15DPqy3d_JX71A)\r\n* C++ interpreter soon\r\n\r\n## Official interpreters' source codes\r\n* [AutoIt](https://github.com/jesobreira/cood/blob/au3-interpreter/interpreter.au3)\r\n* [PHP](https://github.com/jesobreira/cood/blob/php-interpreter/interpreter.php) (command line or [bamcompile](www.bambalam.se/bamcompile)d)\r\n* [Javascript](https://github.com/jesobreira/cood/blob/javascript-interpreter/cood.js)\r\n\r\n## On-line interpreter\r\nAvailable [here](https://jesobreira.github.com/cood)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nAll your scripts will start with a \"Hey, waiter!\".\r\n\r\nWell... this is not mandatory, but it's cool :D\r\n\r\nThen you will have access to 65.535 data cells, starting in pointer 32.767, and will be able to use the following commands:\r\n\r\n| Command\t| Function |\r\n|---------|----------|\r\n|Hey, waiter!|Starts the script.|\r\n|The bill, please.|Ends the script.|\r\n|I want this.|Increases a byte on the current data pointer.|\r\n|I don't want this.|Decreases a byte on the current data pointer.|\r\n|What do you have for dessert?|Increments the data pointer (points to the next cell to the right).|\r\n|What do you have for tidbit?|Decrements the data pointer (points to the next cell in the left).|\r\n|May I ask something?|Reads STDIN (user input).|\r\n|I'm hungry.|Reads the current data pointer value, and adds a trailing line break.|\r\n|I'm very hungry.|Reads the current data pointer, without trailing line break.|\r\n|How much is it?|Reads the current data pointer as decimal value rather than ASCII.|\r\n|I hate this.|Zeroes the current data pointer.|\r\n|I want [number] of this.|Puts [number] value on the current data pointer.|\r\n|More [number] of this.|Adds [number] value to the current data pointer.|\r\n|Less [number] of this.|Decreases [number] value on the current data pointer.|\r\n|What do you suggest?|Starts a loop. Read below about loops.|\r\n|Nothing more?|Ends a loop. Read below about loops.|\r\n|Know a joke? [comment]|Way to comment out your code.|\r\n\r\n*Note: some of my friends reported that, on Windows 8, when using \"May I ask something?\" with the AutoIt interpreter, it is needed to put the value and hit enter twice, so it works fine. As I dislike Windows and hate Windows 8, I can't confirm it. But it seems to be working fine on Windows 7. However, they also reported that the PHP interpreter, bamcompiled (so, an .exe file too) has no problem on reading STDIN stream.*\r\n\r\n#### Loops\r\n\r\nLoops are a way to repeat your code.\r\n\r\nIn Cood, it is made using \"What do you suggest?\" and \"Nothing more?\". All the code between these tags are repeated until the current pointer (it must be the current pointer at the time of \"Nothing more?\" call) is zero. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHey, waiter!\r\nI want 10 of this.\r\nWhat do you suggest?\r\nKnow a joke? This line will run ten times.\r\nI don't want this.\r\nNothing more?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's worth to remember to always decrease the pointer value (or increase if you're using negative values), as the loop doesn't decreases it automatically. This is made using the \"I don't want this.\". Also, the code above won't display anything.\r\n\r\n### Facilities (?)\r\n\r\nOf course you're not going to use any esoteric language on your next project, as esolangs are just for fun. But Cood has some facilities. First, all punctiation (commas, periods) aren't mandatory. You can also indent your code with spaces (as many as you want) or tabs. Also, the code will understand if you replace \"I'm\" with \"I am\", and some others.\r\n\r\n### Debugging\r\n\r\nYou'll have access to a line-by-line simple debugger showing the data pointer value on every command if you put \"--debug\" when running your script. Example:\r\n\r\n> \r\ninterpreter \"My awesome script.cood\" --debug\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n#### Hello world\r\n\r\nLet's start with a \"Hello world\". Of course there are many cool ways to do it, but as we are just starting, let's do the easiest way. Just lookup for a ASCII table and do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHey, waiter!\r\nI want 72 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 101 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 108 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 111 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 32 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 87 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 111 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 114 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 108 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 100 of this.\r\nI'm very hungry.\r\nI want 33 of this.\r\nI'm hungry.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see, every two lines we set the value of the current data pointer to the same decimal value of every char of the string we wanna write, then display it. Simple, huh?\r\n\r\nNow let's loop a little bit.\r\n\r\n#### Countdown\r\n\r\nAs the decimal 0 (zero) value is not the char 0 (zero), and the numbers start at the position 48 on the ASCII char, we must work with two data cells: the first one, with value 10, we will use to loop. The second one, with the value 57 (chr '9'), that we will display. Remember we must decrease both the cells values and move to the right one before the loop ends. We will have something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHey waiter!\r\nKnow a joke? This is a comment\r\nI want 10 of this.\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nI want 57 of this.\r\nWhat do you have for tidbit?\r\nWhat do you suggest?\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nI'm hungry.\r\nI don't want this.\r\nWhat do you have for tidbit?\r\nI don't want this.\r\nNothing more?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the user supplies the number we must loop from?\r\n\r\nThe number must be from 1 to 9, as we are just starting and didn't make support for two-digits numbers.\r\n\r\nSame thing. The current cell will be filled up with the user input. We must copy the value of this cell to other two cells, but as we haven't variables or strcpy() function, we must work hard: we will loop to copy the value of the user input cell to other two cells. So we can do like we did above.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHey waiter!\r\nKnow a joke? This is a comment\r\nMay I ask something?\r\nWhat do you suggest?\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nI want this.\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nI want this.\r\nWhat do you have for tidbit?\r\nWhat do you have for tidbit?\r\nI don't want this.\r\nNothing more?\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nMore 48 of this.\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nWhat do you suggest?\r\nWhat do you have for tidbit?\r\nI'm hungry.\r\nI don't want this.\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nI don't want this.\r\nNothing more?\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Some math\r\n\r\nNow let's create a script that requires the user to write two numbers and then show the sum between them.\r\n\r\nWe will have to store the user's numbers in two different cells, then loop one over another, decreasing one of them and increasing in the other. For example, if the user puts the numbers \"2\" and \"3\", we will have two stacks:\r\n\r\n> \r\n[2] [3]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will loop and add the first stack over the second. So, while we run the loop, this is what happens to our stacks:\r\n\r\n> \r\n[2] \\[3\\]  \\(initial state\\)\r\n>\r\n[1] [4]\r\n>\r\n[0] [5]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is showed on the second stack, and we can show it as decimal.\r\n\r\nWell, here's the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHey, waiter!\r\nKnow a joke? This is the sum calculator.\r\nMay I ask something?\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nMay I ask something?\r\nWhat do you suggest?\r\nWhat do you have for tidbit?\r\nI want this.\r\nWhat do you have for dessert?\r\nI don't want this.\r\nNothing more?\r\nWhat do you have for tidbit?\r\nHow much is it?\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Seriously... What's that for?\r\n\r\nObviously you won't create many things with it, as we have many real programming languages available. Esolangs are just for fun. Also, working with them is always a math and logic challenge, and that's what makes them cool. I wanna challenge you to make a four-operation basic calculator using it (it is possible). Please do not challenge me on creating a Cood compiler cooded in Cood :P\r\n\r\nBon appetit!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
